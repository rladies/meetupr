        Due to unexpected demand, we have opened learning participation to all genders,
        dependent on initial and on-going vetting by the leadership team. However,
        the stated priority of the R-Ladies communities is the development & support
        specifically of those identifying as a minority gender, and we, therefore,
        reserve the right to guard this interest through whatever measures the leadership
        team deems appropriate. Anyone involved with R-Ladies Santa Barbara is expected
        to fully respect each other, the mandate of this community, and the goodwill
        on which R-Ladies is founded, or face expulsion/a penalty of any form, at

        the leadership team. However, the stated priority of the R-Ladies communities
        is the development &amp; support specifically of those identifying as a minority
        gender, and we, therefore, reserve the right to guard this interest through
        whatever measures the leadership team deems appropriate. Anyone involved with
        R-Ladies is expected to fully respect each other, the mandate of this community,

        in the R community, R-Ladies Global. We are a network of women R practitioners
        in Porto Alegre. Our goals are to provide a supportive and encouraging network
        for R users who identify as female and to promote learning and collaboration
        in the R community. We are emphatically LGBTQ friendly and open to any women
        interested in programming in R, from experts to novices. Join us!</p>\\n<p>Community
        Policies & Code of Conduct: the leadership, mentoring & teaching roles within
        this Community are held exclusively by females (male speakers may be allowed/invited
        as one-off guests in exceptional circumstances at the leadership team's discretion).
        Due to unexpected demand, we have opened learning participation to all genders,
        dependent on initial and on-going vetting by the leadership team. However,
        the stated priority of the R-Ladies communities is the development & support
        specifically of those identifying as female, and we therefore reserve the
        right to guard this interest through whatever measures the leadership team
        deem appropriate. Anyone involved with R-Ladies is expected to fully respect
        each other, the mandate of this community, and the goodwill on which R-Ladies
        is founded, or face expulsion/a penalty of any form, at the discretion of
        the leadership team. Photos, Films and all other media/recordings: photographs
        and/or video/other media will be taken at events held by this community. By
