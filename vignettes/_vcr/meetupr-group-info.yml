        is a world-wide organization to promote gender diversity in the R community.\nR-Ladies
        welcomes members of all R proficiency levels, whether you''re a new or aspiring
        R user, or an experienced R programmer interested in mentoring, networking
        & expert upskilling. Our community is designed to develop our members'' R
        skills & knowledge through social, collaborative learning & sharing. Supporting
        minority identity access to STEM skills & careers, the Free Software Movement,
        and contributing to the global R community!\nThis is a local chapter of R-Ladies
        Global, an organisation that promotes gender diversity in the R community
        worldwide. We are pro-actively inclusive of queer, trans, and all minority
        identities, with additional sensitivity to intersectional identities. Our
        priority is to provide a safe community space for anyone identifying as a
        minority gender who is interested in and/or working with R. As a founding
        principle, there is no cost or charge to participate in any of our R-Ladies
        communities around the world.\nWe are part of Global R-Ladies group. You can
        access our presentations, R scripts, and Projects on our Github account and

        Community Policies & Code of Conduct:\nThe leadership, mentoring & teaching
        roles within this Community are held exclusively by minority genders (majority
        gender speakers may be allowed/invited as one-off guests in exceptional circumstances
        at the leadership team''s discretion). Due to unexpected demand, we have opened
        learning participation to all genders, dependent on initial and on-going vetting
        by the leadership team. However, the stated priority of the R-Ladies communities
        is the development & support specifically of those identifying as a minority
        gender, and we, therefore, reserve the right to guard this interest through
        whatever measures the leadership team deems appropriate. Anyone involved with
        R-Ladies is expected to fully respect each other, the mandate of this community,
        and the goodwill on which R-Ladies is founded, or face expulsion/a penalty
        of any form, at the discretion of the leadership team.\nFull community guidelines
        are found here: [https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki](https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki)\nP.P.S.
        Photos, Films and all other media/recordings:\nPhotos, Films, and all other
        media/recordings: photographs and/or video/other media will be taken at events
        held by this community. By taking part in an R-Ladies event you grant the
        community organizers full rights to use the images resulting from the photography/video
