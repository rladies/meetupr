        New DVDC Members!\n\nIs Data Visualization a science or an art? Our goal is
        to create great events where everyones'' experiences reflect that sentiment,
        and we are beginning a great speaker in Joseph Sexton (http://www.terpconnect.umd.edu/~jsexton/).
        Joe will give us a glimpse of his department''s unique global ecological datasets,
        with stunning visuals, and what goes into unparalleled GIS data. Joe''s datasets
        include DISCO (Dynamic Impervious Surface Cover Observations) and global 30-m
        resolution continuous fields of tree cover from 2000 - 2005. Elizabeth Lyon
        will show us the next evolution of Wikipedia with interactive map visualization
        by MapStory.\n\nWe are excited to have NClud host the event, they have a great
        aesthetic downtown space that facilitates networking as well as presentations,
        and as with all Data Community DC (http://www.meetup.com/Data-Visualization-DC/events/103349942/www.datacommunitydc.org)
        events we cap the night with Data Drinks.\n\nAgenda\n\n6:30pm -- Networking

        is a research professor at the University of Maryland whose research focuses
        on ecosystem dynamics and the remote sensing methods required to monitor landscape
        changes over time. He developes statistical and ecological analyses for the
        Global Forest Cover Change Project (http://glcf.umiacs.umd.edu/research/portal/gfcc/index.shtml),
        a joint project of the Global Land Cover Facility (http://www.glcf.umd.edu/index.shtml),
        NASA''s Goddard Space Flight Center (http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/home/index.html),
        and South Dakota State University (http://globalmonitoring.sdstate.edu/).
        The project is mining more than thirty years of Landsat images to map changes
        in Earth''s forest cover from 1975 to 2005. Joe also contributes ecological,
        statistical, and remote sensing expertise to collaborative studies of urban
        heat islands, threatened and endangered species habitat, tropical deforestation,
        climate effects on boreal biomes, and urban growth.\n\nElizabeth Lyon\n\nLiz
