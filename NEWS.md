# meetupr development version

## Breaking changes

* All mentions of and arguments related to API keys have been removed as the Meetup API no longer supports authentication with an API key.

## New features

* Added automatic rate limiting based on the response headers.
* Added support for non-interactive use.
* Added functions for getting pro events and groups.

## Internals

* Renamed `api_method` to `api_path` in internal function, `.fetch_results()`, as it's less confusing.

# meetupr 0.1.1
* Added `get_event_rsvps()` function.  Contribution by Michael Beigelmacher: https://github.com/rladies/meetupr/pull/19

# meetupr 0.1.0

* Added `NEWS.md` file.
* **BREAKING CHANGE**: Updated `get_events()`, `get_boards()`, and `get_members()` to output a tibble with summarised information. The raw content previously output by these functions can be found in the `resource` column of each output tibble.  
* **BREAKING CHANGE**: Changed the name of `get_meetup_attendees()` and `get_meetup_comments()` to `get_comments()` and `get_attendees()` for distinction (all other `get_*` functions get something about a group, not a specific event from that group).  Also updated the output of these functions from lists to tibbles. The raw content previously output by these functions can be found in the `resource` column of each output tibble.  
* Officially deprecated the `get_meetup_attendees()` and `get_meetup_comments()` functions.
* Added a bunch of fields to the `get_events()` output.
* Added ability to pass in a vector of statuses for `event_status` in addition to a single string.
* Added `find_groups()` function to get list of groups using text-based search.
* Added short vignette to demonstrate the use of the new `find_groups()` function.
* Added `...` option to `.quick_fetch()` and `.fetch_results()` (in `internals.R`) to use any parameter in the `GET` request. 
* Removed `LazyData = TRUE` from DESCRIPTION file (this is not needed becasue there is no dataset shipped within the package).
* Added `.get_api_key()` internal function which is used inside `.fetch_results()` so now if `api_key = NULL` it will automatically populate that variable with the `MEETUP_KEY` environemnt variable, if available.
* Added a printout of how many results are returned for a query so users will understand why it's taking a while for the function to finish executing.
* Renamed `api_params` to `api_method` in internal function, `.fetch_results()`, since that's the official name for what that argument represents.
* Added several new columns to the `get_members()` result tibble (e.g. bio, city, country, lat, lon, etc)
* Added a References section in the R docs for each function which includes a link to the official Meetup API documentation for each endpoint.


# meetupr 0.0.1

* Initial release.
