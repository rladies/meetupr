        Remote welcomes members of all R proficiency levels, whether you''re a new
        or aspiring R user, or an experienced R programmer interested in mentoring,
        networking & expert upskilling. Our community is designed to develop our members''
        R skills & knowledge through social, collaborative learning & sharing. Supporting
        minority identity access to STEM skills & careers, the Free Software Movement,
        and contributing to the global R community! <br>A local chapter of R-Ladies
        Global, R-Ladies Remote exists to promote gender diversity in the R community
        worldwide. We are pro-actively inclusive of queer, trans, and all minority
        identities, with additional sensitivity to intersectional identities. Our
        priority is to provide a safe community space for anyone identifying as a
        minority gender who is interested in and/or working with R. As a founding
        principle, there is no cost or charge to participate in any of our R-Ladies
        communities around the world. <br>We are part of Global R-Ladies group. You
        can access our presentations, R scripts, and Projects on our Github account
        and follow us on twitter to stay up to date about R-Ladies news! <br><br></p>\n<p>Website:

        <br><br></p>\n<p><i>PS Community Policies & Code of Conduct: <br>The leadership,
        mentoring & teaching roles within this Community are held exclusively by minority
        genders (majority gender speakers may be allowed/invited as one-off guests
        in exceptional circumstances at the leadership team''s discretion). Due to
        unexpected demand, we have opened learning participation to all genders, dependent
        on initial and on-going vetting by the leadership team. However, the stated
        priority of the R-Ladies communities is the development & support specifically
        of those identifying as a minority gender, and we, therefore, reserve the
        right to guard this interest through whatever measures the leadership team
        deems appropriate. Anyone involved with R-Ladies Remote is expected to fully
        respect each other, the mandate of this community, and the goodwill on which
        R-Ladies is founded, or face expulsion/a penalty of any form, at the discretion
        of the leadership team. <br></i><br></p>\n<p>Full community guidelines are
