        Olson will be leading us on a data cleaning journey! Data cleaning can be
        the most time consuming part of a statistician\u2019s workflow, and the validity
        of the conclusions from a data analysis can depend on this simple data cleaning.
        At the Conference of Statistical Practice 2018, Molly took a short course
        titled \u201cCleaning up the Data Cleaning Process: Challenges and Solutions
        in R,\u201d taught by Anne Helby Petersen and Claus Thorn Ekstrøm from the
        section of Biostatistics, University of Copenhagen. The short course introduced
        an R package called \u201cdataMaid\u201d that is a \u201csystematic, analytical
        approach to data cleaning that will ensure the data cleaning process to be
        just as structured and well-documented as the rest of the data analysis.\u201d
        In this tutorial, Molly will provide an overview of the dataMaid package and
        demonstrate how to use the dataMaid package to improve efficiency and accuracy
        in the statistician\u2019s every day data cleaning.</p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1524496938000,"duration":7200000,"id":"250068352","name":"Dynamically

        combined that idea with code for generating dynamic, tabbed tables (developed
