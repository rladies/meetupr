        Olson will be leading us on a data cleaning journey! Data cleaning can be
        the most time consuming part of a statistician\u2019s workflow, and the validity
        of the conclusions from a data analysis can depend on this simple data cleaning.
        At the Conference of Statistical Practice 2018, Molly took a short course
        titled \u201cCleaning up the Data Cleaning Process: Challenges and Solutions
        in R,\u201d taught by Anne Helby Petersen and Claus Thorn Ekstrøm from the
        section of Biostatistics, University of Copenhagen. The short course introduced
        an R package called \u201cdataMaid\u201d that is a \u201csystematic, analytical
        approach to data cleaning that will ensure the data cleaning process to be
        just as structured and well-documented as the rest of the data analysis.\u201d
        In this tutorial, Molly will provide an overview of the dataMaid package and
        demonstrate how to use the dataMaid package to improve efficiency and accuracy
        in the statistician\u2019s every day data cleaning.</p> ","visibility":"public","pro_is_email_shared":false,"member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1524496938000,"duration":7200000,"id":"250068352","name":"Dynamically

        in more sophisticated options with data display in Shiny?<br/>Do you sometimes
        not know in advance how many tables you will need to generate in your Shiny
        app - perhaps one summary table for each year/month/category in a user-provided
        dataset? Join us to learn how to dynamically generate summary tables, present
        them as tabs in one Shiny box, and include an option to click to see details
        about each data table row.</p> <p>Judy Lewis will demonstrate the IeDEA Harmonist
        Data Toolkit under development to facilitate data quality checking, visualization,
        and sharing of international observational HIV/AIDS data. At rstudio::conf
        2018, Judy learned from Barbara Borges Ribeiro about adding options for shinyDashboard

        class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/bborgesr/rstudio-conf-2018</a>). Judy
        combined that idea with code for generating dynamic, tabbed tables (developed
        with Jeremy Stephens at VUMC Biostats) to create the desired function in Shiny.
        Judy will share code and sample data for attendees to try it out on their
