R interface to the Meetup GraphQL API

## Installation

Install the CRAN version:

```r
install.packages("meetupr")
```

To install the development version from R-universe:

```r
install.packages(
  'meetupr', 
  repos = c(
    'https://rladies.r-universe.dev', 
    'https://cloud.r-project.org'
  )
)
```

or from GitHub:

```r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("rladies/meetupr")
```

## Authentication

meetupr uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication with the Meetup API. The first
time you run a meetupr function, youâ€™ll be prompted to authorize the
application in your browser. Your token will be cached for future
sessions.

## Usage

### Get group events

```{r}
library(meetupr)

events <- get_events("rladies-san-francisco", "past")
```

### Get group members

```{r}
members <- get_group_members("rladies-san-francisco")
head(members)
```

### Search for groups

```{r}
groups <- find_groups("R-Ladies") |>
  dplyr::arrange(desc(founded_date))
```

### Pro network access

For Meetup Pro networks, note that user needs to be a **pro** network organiser to access the data.

``` r
# Get all groups in a pro network
pro_groups <- get_pro_groups("rladies")

# Get events from a pro network
pro_events <- get_pro_events("rladies", max_results = 10)
```
