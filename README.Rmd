R interface to the Meetup GraphQL API

## Installation

To install the current version from R-Universe (recommended):

```r
install.packages(
  'meetupr', 
  repos = c(
    'https://rladies.r-universe.dev', 
    'https://cloud.r-project.org'
  )
)
```

To install the development version from GitHub:

```r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("rladies/meetupr")
```

## Authentication

meetupr uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication with the Meetup API. 
The first time you run a meetupr function, you'll be prompted to authorize the application in your browser. 
Your token will be cached for future sessions.

## Usage

### Get group events

```{r}
#| label: events

library(meetupr)

events <- get_events("rladies-san-francisco", "past")
```

### Get group members

```{r}
#| label: members

members <- get_group_members("rladies-san-francisco")
head(members)
```

### Search for groups

```{r}
#| label: groups

groups <- find_groups("R-Ladies")
dplyr::arrange(groups, desc(founded_date))
```

### Pro network access

For Meetup Pro networks:

```{r}
#| label: pro

# Get all groups in a pro network
pro_groups <- get_pro_groups("rladies")

# Get events from a pro network
pro_events <- get_pro_events("rladies", status = "upcoming")
```
