## ⚠️ ALERT TO USERS:

Meetup has deprecated the REST API that's used in this package.  We are working to [add support](https://github.com/rladies/meetupr/issues/118) for their new API but unfortnately that means that the package is not currently functional.  If you'd like to help with this transition in any way (we could use help with testing and documentation in particular), please comment on the this [issue](https://github.com/rladies/meetupr/issues/118).

R interface to the [Meetup API](https://www.meetup.com/meetup_api/) (v3)

## Installation

To install the development version from GitHub:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("rladies/meetupr")
```
A released version will be on CRAN [soon](https://github.com/rladies/meetupr/issues/24).

## Usage

### Authentication

#### API key? No

```{r child='man/rmd-fragments/api-key.Rmd'}
```

#### OAuth? Yes

```{r child='man/rmd-fragments/oauth.Rmd'}
```

### Functions

See the [pkgdown reference](https://rladies.github.io/meetupr/reference/index.html).

For example, the following code will get all upcoming events for the [R-Ladies San Francisco](https://meetup.com/rladies-san-francisco) meetup.

```{r}
library(meetupr)

urlname <- "rladies-san-francisco"
events <- get_events(urlname)
dplyr::arrange(events, desc(time))
```

We can also search for groups with free text.

```{r}
groups <- find_groups("R-Ladies")
dplyr::arrange(groups, desc(created))
```


## How can you contribute?

We are looking for new people to join the list of contributors!  Please take a look at the open [issues](https://github.com/rladies/meetupr/issues), file a new issue, contribute tests, or improve the documentation.  We are also looking to expand the set of functions to include more endpoints from the [Meetup API](https://www.meetup.com/meetup_api/).  Lastly, we'd also love to [hear about](https://github.com/rladies/meetupr/issues/74) any applications of the **meetupr** package, so we can compile a list of demos!
