R interface to the Meetup API (v3)

## Installation

To install the development version from GitHub:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rladies/meetupr")
```
A released version will be on CRAN soon.

## Usage

To use this package, you will first need to get your meetup API key. To do so, go to this link: [https://secure.meetup.com/meetup_api/key/](https://secure.meetup.com/meetup_api/key/)

Once you have your key, save it as an environment variable for the current session by running the following:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
Sys.setenv(MEETUP_KEY = "PASTE YOUR MEETUP KEY HERE")
```

Alternatively, you can set it permanently with the help of `usethis::edit_r_environ()` by adding the line to your `.Renviron`: 

```
MEETUP_KEY=PASTE YOUR MEETUP KEY HERE
```

If you don't want to save it here, you can input it in each function using the `api_key` parameter (just be sure not to send any documents with your key to GitHub `r emo::ji("speak_no_evil")`).

We currently have the following functions:

* `get_members()`
* `get_boards()`
* `get_events()`  
* `get_event_attendees()`  
* `get_event_comments()`
* `get_event_rsvps()`
* `find_groups()`

Each will output a tibble with information extracted into from the API as well as a `list-col` named `*_resource` with all API output. For example, the following code will get all upcoming events for the [R-Ladies San Francisco](https://meetup.com/rladies-san-francisco) meetup.

```{r}
library(meetupr)

urlname <- "rladies-san-francisco"
events <- get_events(urlname, "past")
dplyr::arrange(events, desc(created))
```


## How can you contribute?

Take a look at some resources:

- [https://www.meetup.com/meetup_api/](https://www.meetup.com/meetup_api/)
- [https://www.meetup.com/meetup_api/clients/](https://www.meetup.com/meetup_api/clients/)



In order to run our tests, you will have to set the `urlname` for meetup you belong to as an environment variable using the following code:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
Sys.setenv(MEETUP_NAME = "YOUR MEETUP NAME")
```

### TODO:
- add tests
