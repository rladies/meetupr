\description{
Create your own query to the Meetup API
(https://www.meetup.com/meetup_api/docs/).
This function is convenient if you want to create
a query to other Meetup API endpoints that we
have not created functions for. If you do create
a function that queries a currently unsupported
endpoint and a results tidier for this, we are happy
to receive PR's with your suggestion.
