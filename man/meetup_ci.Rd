\title{Meetup API CI Authentication}
\usage{
meetup_ci_setup(client_name = Sys.getenv("MEETUP_CLIENT_NAME", "meetupr"))

meetup_ci_load(client_name = Sys.getenv("MEETUP_CLIENT_NAME", "meetupr"))
}
\arguments{
\item{client_name}{A string representing the name of the client. By
default, it is set to \code{"meetupr"} and retrieved from the
\code{MEETUP_CLIENT_NAME} environment variable.}
}
\value{
\itemize{
\item \code{meetup_setup_ci()}: Returns the encoded base64 authentication token
invisibly.
\item \code{meetup_load_ci()}: Returns \code{TRUE} invisibly if the token was successfully
loaded.
}
}
\description{
Functions to manage Meetup API authentication in Continuous Integration (CI)
environments. \code{meetup_setup_ci()} prepares authentication credentials for CI
use by encoding tokens, while \code{meetup_load_ci()} loads and decodes those
credentials in the CI environment.
}
\details{
\subsection{Setting up CI Authentication}{

\code{meetup_setup_ci()} performs the following steps:
\itemize{
\item Checks if the user has authenticated with the Meetup API
\item Reads the existing token file from the OAuth cache directory
\item Encodes the token file contents into a base64 string
\item Stores credentials in the keyring with service name "meetupr"
\item Provides guidance for setting environment variables in CI
\item Copies the encoded token to the clipboard (if available)
}
}

\subsection{Loading CI Authentication}{

\code{meetup_load_ci()} requires the following to be stored in the keyring
(typically populated from environment variables in CI):
\itemize{
\item \code{token}: The base64-encoded token string
(service: "meetupr", username: "token")
\item \code{token_file}: The name of the token file
(service: "meetupr", username: "token_file")
}

The decoded token is saved in the OAuth cache directory at:
\code{{oauth_cache_path}/{client_name}/{token_file}}
}

\subsection{Environment Variables for CI}{

When using the environment backend (automatically selected when keyring
support is unavailable, such as on CRAN or headless CI systems), credentials
are stored as:
\itemize{
\item \code{meetupr:token} - The base64-encoded token
\item \code{meetupr:token_file} - The token filename
}
}
}

\itemize{
\item \code{meetup_ci_setup()}: Setup authentication for CI environments

\item \code{meetup_ci_load()}: Load authentication from CI environment

}}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Setup CI authentication (run locally):
meetup_setup_ci()

# In your CI pipeline, load the credentials:
meetup_load_ci()

# Custom client name:
meetup_setup_ci(client_name = "my_custom_client")
meetup_load_ci(client_name = "my_custom_client")
