\title{Setup Meetup Authentication for CI Environments}
\usage{
meetup_auth_setup_ci(client_name = Sys.getenv("MEETUP_CLIENT_NAME", "meetupr"))
}
\arguments{
\item{client_name}{A string representing the name of the client. By
default, it is set to \code{"meetupr"} and retrieved from the
\code{MEETUP_CLIENT_NAME} environment variable.}
}
\value{
The encoded base64 authentication token as a character string.
Returns invisibly.
}
\description{
This function guides the user through setting up Meetup API authentication
for use in non-interactive Continuous Integration (CI) environments. It
encodes the existing authentication token as a base64 string and provides
instructions for storing it securely as environment variables in a CI
pipeline.
}
\details{
The function performs the following steps:
\itemize{
\item Checks if the user has authenticated with the Meetup API. If not,
it prompts the user to authenticate interactively.
\item Reads the existing token file from the OAuth cache directory.
\item Encodes the token file contents into a base64 string.
\item Provides guidance to the user for storing the base64 token (\code{MEETUP_TOKEN})
and token file name (\code{MEETUP_TOKEN_FILE}) as environment variables.
\item Copies the encoded token to the clipboard (if the \code{clipr} package is
installed and the clipboard is available).
\item Displays example YAML configuration snippets for use in GitHub Actions.
